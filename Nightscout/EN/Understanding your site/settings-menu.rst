   -  The default ``log`` (logarithmic) option will let you see more
      detail towards the lower range, while still showing the full CGM
      range.
   -  The ``linear`` option has equidistant tick marks, the range used
      is dynamic so that space at the top of chart isn't wasted.
   -  The ``log-dynamic`` is similar to the default ``log`` options, but
      uses the same dynamic range and the ``linear`` scale.
