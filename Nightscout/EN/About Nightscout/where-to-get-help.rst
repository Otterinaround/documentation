Where to get help
==========

Nightscout is a community-led project and as such there is no warranty nor dedicated support group you can contact. That said, there is an active community helping each other out. Usually help is only minutes away. There are three main channels through which you can get help.

- The best way find help is to join the Facebook group `CGM in the Cloud <https://www.facebook.com/groups/cgminthecloud/>`_ and post a question.
- Reach out on `Gitter <https://gitter.im/nightscout/public>`_, a chat room.
- If you have found a bug in Nightscout, you can `open an issue <https://github.com/nightscout/documentation/issues>`_. If you are not sure what you have found is a bug, it makes sense to discuss with the community on Facebook or Gitter before opening the issue.

In all of the cases above, it makes sense to provide some context while asking for help. For example, if you are having trouble with installation, which service are you using, Heroku or Azure? What messages are you seeing? Providing some context allows the community members who want to help you some starting information to get the ball rolling.
