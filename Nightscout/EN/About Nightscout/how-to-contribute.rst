How to contribute
==========

Nightscout is a community-led project and the most valuable contribution you can make is your time. Every little bit helps.

Documentation
-------------

Nightscout has a legacy which includes documentation scattered across multiple sites. This site is an attempt to pull all that documentation together into one place and have it available for the community to update. Options for helping with documentation include:

- Updating this documentation. If you find a mistake or that information is incomplete, the fastest way to help out is to submit the change yourself via a method called a *pull request* to the documentation repository `Nightscout documentation <https://github.com/nightscout/documentation>`_ on Github. 
  
| 	There is a handy guide to explain what a pull request is and how to raise one in the #OpenAPS documentation, `here <https://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/Resources/my-first-pr.html>`_. Note that clicking the link takes you to another project, #OpenAPS, however the instructions for a pull request are the same for the Nightscout project.
    
- If you are unable to raise a pull request yourself, you can notify the community of a `documentation issue <https://github.com/nightscout/documentation/issues>`_. The community would prefer you do this via a pull request though! We highly value direct contribution.
- If you find another site hosting Nightscout documentation which appears to be out of date or redundant, you can notify us via a `documentation issue <https://github.com/nightscout/documentation/issues>`_ as well.
- If you'd like to volunteer for a larger block of work, such as translation of the documentation or review prior to a new release of Nightscout, reach out on `Gitter <https://gitter.im/nightscout/public>`_.
